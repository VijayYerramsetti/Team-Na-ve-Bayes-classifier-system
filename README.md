# Team-Na-ve-Bayes-classifier-system


<b> Description </b> <br>

Our team able to develop a Naïve Bayes model that makes predictions about a customer’s
annual income given a set of characteristics from the U.S. census with a recall metric of 80%.

Loaded the data set in jupyter, Identified and replaced the missing values on python.

Reviewed the script with different data sets. 

Reduced the number of bins and trained the model to get best results.
